# Warrant Node.js Library

Use [Warrant](https://warrant.dev/) in server-side Node.js projects.

## Installation

Use `npm` to install the Warrant module:

```sh
npm install @warrantdev/warrant-node
```

## Usage
Import the Warrant client and pass your API key to the constructor to get started:
```js
import {Client as Warrant} from "@warrantdev/warrant-node";

const warrant = new Warrant('api_prod_f5dsKVeYnVSLHGje44zAygqgqXiLJBICbFzCiAg1E=');
```

### `createUser(userId, roleId)`
This method creates a user entity in Warrant with the specified `userId` and assigns the created user the role with the specified `roleId`.

```js
import {Client as Warrant} from "@warrantdev/warrant-node";

const warrant = new Warrant('api_prod_f5dsKVeYnVSLHGje44zAygqgqXiLJBICbFzCiAg1E=');

// Creates a user with user.id as the userId and
// assigns the new user the "store_owner" role
warrant.createUser(user.id, "store_owner");
```

### `createSession(userId)`
This method creates a session in Warrant for the user with the specified `userId` and returns a session token which can be used to make authorized requests to the Warrant API only for the specified user. This session token can safely be used to make requests to the Warrant API's authorization endpoint to determine user access in web and mobile client applications.

```js
import {Client as Warrant} from "@warrantdev/warrant-node";

const warrant = new Warrant('api_prod_f5dsKVeYnVSLHGje44zAygqgqXiLJBICbFzCiAg1E=');

// Creates a session token scoped to the specified userId
// Return this token to your client application to allow
// it to make requests for the given user.
const sessionToken = warrant.createSession(user.id);
```

### `isAuthorized(userId, permissionName)`

This method returns a `Promise` that resolves with `true` if the user with the specified `userId` has been granted the permission with the specified `permissionName` and `false` otherwise.

```js
import {Client as Warrant} from "@warrantdev/warrant-node";

const warrant = new Warrant('api_prod_f5dsKVeYnVSLHGje44zAygqgqXiLJBICbFzCiAg1E=');

//
// Example Scenario:
// An e-commerce website where Store Owners can edit their own Store's info
//
if (warrant.isAuthorized(userSession.userId, "edit_stores")) {
    // Carry out logic to allow user to edit a Store
}
```

Weâ€™ve used a random API key in these code examples. Replace it with your
[actual publishable API keys](https://app.warrant.dev) to
test this code through your own Warrant account.

For more information on how to use the Warrant API, please refer to the
[Warrant API reference](https://docs.warrant.dev).

Note that we may release new [minor and patch](https://semver.org/) versions of
`@warrantdev/warrant-node` with small but backwards-incompatible fixes to the type
declarations. These changes will not affect Warrant itself.

## TypeScript support

This package includes TypeScript declarations for Warrant.
